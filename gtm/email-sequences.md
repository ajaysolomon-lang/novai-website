## SEQUENCE 1: Provider Cold Outreach (5-email drip)

### Email 1 — Day 0: The Hook
```
Subject: [Name], LA customers are looking for [their service]

Hey [Name],

I found your [Yelp page / Google listing / website] and wanted to
reach out directly.

WorkBench is a local services marketplace launching in LA. We're
curating the best service providers in each category — and [their
service] in [their area] is one of our priority categories right now.

What that means for you:
- Customers find and book you directly
- You set your own rates
- No bidding against 50 other providers
- Way lower fees than Thumbtack or Angi

Free to sign up. No lock-in. Takes 5 minutes:
→ workbench.novaisystems.online/signup

Worth a look?

### Email 2 — Day 3: Social Proof
```
Subject: How [similar provider] got 4 bookings in the first week

Hey [Name],

Quick follow-up. Wanted to share what's happening with providers
who've already joined WorkBench:

- [Provider type] in [area] — 4 bookings in week one
- [Provider type] in [area] — fully booked for the month
- Average provider sees first booking within 5 days

We're still building out [their category] in [their area], so

### Email 3 — Day 7: Direct Value
```
Subject: Quick math on WorkBench vs [Thumbtack/Angi]

Hey [Name],

Let's be real about platform fees:

Thumbtack: $15-70 per lead (shared with competitors)
Angi: 15-20% commission + monthly fees
HomeAdvisor: $15-100 per lead

WorkBench: Small service fee. You keep more. Period.

Plus — customers book you directly. No bidding. No competing for
the same lead with 10 other people.

If you're spending money on leads that don't convert, this is
worth trying. Free signup, no risk:

### Email 4 — Day 12: Urgency
```

Hey [Name],

We cap providers per category per area to keep quality high.
[Their category] in [their area] is almost at capacity.

If you've been thinking about it — now's the time.

Once you're in, you're in. No rush after that — set up your
profile whenever works for you.

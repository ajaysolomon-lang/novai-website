# WorkBench DM Scripts — Social Outreach (LA)

## Platform-Specific Scripts

### Instagram DM — Provider Acquisition

like you. Way better deal than Thumbtack/Yelp.

Would you be open to checking it out? Free to join.
```

**Follow-up if they respond positively:**
```
Appreciate it! Here's the deal:

- You set your rates
- Customers find and book you directly
- No bidding wars, no crazy fees
- We vet every provider so customers trust the platform

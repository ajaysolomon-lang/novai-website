# WorkBench Outbound Call Scripts — LA Local Services

## Provider Acquisition Call (Primary — Supply Side)

### Opener (first 15 seconds decide everything)
```
Hey [Name], this is [Agent] with WorkBench — we're a local services
marketplace launching in LA. I'm reaching out because [specific reason:
saw your Yelp listing / Google Business / referral / neighborhood].

Quick question — are you currently getting enough new clients, or is
that something you'd want more of?
```

### If YES they want more clients:
```
That's exactly why I'm calling. WorkBench connects vetted local pros
like you directly with customers in LA who are actively looking for
[their service category].

No bidding wars. No 30-40% platform cuts. You set your rates, you
control your schedule. Customers find you and book directly.

We're onboarding providers in [their area] right now — takes about
5 minutes to get your profile set up. Can I walk you through it?
```

### If they push back — "I'm good / busy":
```
Totally respect that. Quick thought though — we're not Thumbtack or
TaskRabbit where you're competing against 50 other bids. WorkBench
is curated. Fewer providers per category means more visibility for you.

It's free to sign up, no lock-in. Most providers tell us they get
their first booking within the first week. Worth 5 minutes?
```

### Common Objections:

**"What does it cost?"**
```
Fair and transparent — we take a small service fee, way less than
what Thumbtack, Angi, or HomeAdvisor charge. No monthly subscription.
You only pay when you actually get business. I can walk you through
the exact numbers for [their category] — it'll take 60 seconds.
```

**"I already use [Thumbtack/Yelp/Angi/etc]"**
```
Most of our providers do too. The difference is — on those platforms
you're paying for leads that go to 10 other people. On WorkBench,
customers browse and book YOU directly. No lead fees, no bidding.
Think of it as an additional channel — not a replacement. Free to try.
```

**"I don't trust online platforms"**
```
I hear that. That's actually why we built WorkBench differently.
We vet every provider before they go live — it protects you too,
because customers trust the listings more. And you set your own
rates, your own availability. You're in control. No algorithms
deciding who sees you.
```

**"Send me info / I'll think about it"**
```
Absolutely. What's the best email? I'll send you the link to set up
your profile — takes 5 minutes whenever you're ready. And I'll
include a couple case studies of providers in [their category] who
are already getting bookings. Sound good?

[CAPTURE: name, email, phone, service category, area]
```

### Close:
```
Great — I've got you set up. You'll get an email with your profile
link. Once you fill it out, our team reviews it within a couple days
and you're live. Customers in [their area] will start seeing you
right away.

Any questions before I let you go? Welcome to WorkBench.

services marketplace in LA — connecting people with vetted service
providers in their neighborhood.

Have you ever had trouble finding a reliable [plumber/cleaner/
handyman/etc] in [their area]?
```

### If YES:
```
That's the problem we're solving. WorkBench has vetted local pros
in [their area] — you can browse profiles, see ratings, check
pricing, and book directly. No fees on your end, ever.

Right now we've got providers across home services, business
services, and lifestyle — everything from plumbers to personal
trainers.

Can I set you up with a free account? Takes 30 seconds.
```

### If they're interested:
```
Perfect. I just need:
- Your name
- Email

- What kind of services you typically need

You'll get instant access to browse and book. And if you ever need
something specific, just tell us — we'll match you directly.

browsing right away at workbench.novaisystems.online. Zero fees,
zero hassle. Welcome to WorkBench.
```

## Inbound Call Script (Customer or Provider calling in)

### Greeting:
```
WorkBench, this is [Agent]. How can I help you?
```

### Route based on intent:

**"I want to sign up / list my services"**
```
Great — are you looking to hire a service provider, or are you a
provider who wants to get listed?

[Route to appropriate signup flow]
[CAPTURE all info on the call]
```

**"How does it work?"**
```
Simple — WorkBench is a local services marketplace for LA.

If you need a service: browse our directory, check profiles and
reviews, book directly. Free for you, always.

If you're a service provider: set up your profile, list your
services and rates, get discovered by customers in your area.
Fair fees, no lock-in.

Which side are you on?
```

**"I have a problem with [booking/payment/account]"**
```
Let me help with that right now. Can I get your name and the
email you signed up with?

[Look up account, resolve issue, or escalate to admin]
```

**"What areas do you cover?"**
```
Right now we're focused on greater Los Angeles — that's our
launch market. We're expanding soon, but LA is where we deliver
the best experience. If you're in LA, you're covered.
